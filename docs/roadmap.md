# Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap promotes the build targets from [WORK.md](../WORK.md) into a tracked implementation sequence. Keep it current as commits land.

## Current Target

M2 is the current target: render a pane surface from server-owned state and send basic keyboard input back to the daemon.

Done:

- Initial architecture notes in [WORK.md](../WORK.md).
- ADR 0001 for backend-owned terminal state.
- ADR 0002 for Rust as the core runtime.
- Initial M0 schema in [schema/nmux.fbs](../schema/nmux.fbs).
- M0 protocol notes in [docs/protocol.md](protocol.md).
- Reproducible schema validation through `nix develop path:$PWD -c make check-schema`.
- Rust workspace and generated protocol crate for core implementation.
- Bounded FlatBuffers envelope framing.
- Initial Rust session model that encodes a `WorkspaceTreeSnapshot`.
- Local `nmuxd` and `nmux` skeletons that exchange the initial workspace snapshot over a Unix socket.
- Static server-owned `PaneSurfaceSnapshot` and dumb client text rendering.

Next:

- Send basic keyboard input from `nmux` back to `nmuxd`.
- Let `nmuxd` update pane surface state in response to input.
- Introduce a `PaneSurfacePatch` path for state changes after the initial snapshot.

## Milestones

### M0: Protocol Contract

Goal: define the smallest state-sync schema that can carry workspace tree snapshots, pane surface snapshots, pane surface patches, input events, resize intents, and errors.

Exit evidence:

- `schema/nmux.fbs` exists.
- Schema validation runs from a documented command.
- `docs/protocol.md` explains M0 scope and exclusions.

### M1: Local nmuxd Skeleton

Goal: start a local daemon that can own a single session, tab, and pane, accept a local client connection, and exchange M0 envelopes.

Exit evidence:

- A local server command starts.
- A local client command attaches.
- The client receives a `WorkspaceTreeSnapshot`.
- Tests cover envelope encode/decode and initial session creation.

Status: Done for the static local skeleton. See [docs/running.md](running.md).

### M2: Dumb Viewer

Goal: render a pane surface from server-owned state and send basic keyboard input back to the daemon.

Exit evidence:

- A simple TUI or web viewer can attach locally.
- The viewer renders a surface snapshot.
- Input events reach the daemon with actor and pane IDs.

Status: Partial. The local client renders a static server-owned `PaneSurfaceSnapshot`; input events are next.

### M3: Reconnect

Goal: allow a client to reconnect with known object versions and receive either patches or a fresh snapshot.

Exit evidence:

- A test demonstrates reconnect from a current version.
- A test demonstrates stale reconnect falling back to a full snapshot.

### M4: Scrollback Object

Goal: introduce scrollback as a separate synchronized object with lazy range fetches.

Exit evidence:

- Scrollback chunks are versioned separately from the visible surface.
- Tests cover consistency between visible rows and scrollback ranges.

### M5: Multi-Player

Goal: support multiple actors with presence and read-only vs read-write attach modes.

Exit evidence:

- Two clients can attach to one session.
- Presence updates identify actors and capabilities.
- Read-only clients cannot send pane input.

### M6: Sandbox Host

Goal: isolate process hosting behind a local/container/sandbox host abstraction.

Exit evidence:

- Pane process lifecycle is mediated by a host interface.
- Local and sandbox host choices are represented without changing the protocol core.

### M7: Ghostty Frontend

Goal: prove a native Ghostty/libghostty-facing frontend path.

Exit evidence:

- The project has a documented answer for external surface rendering.
- A prototype frontend can render server-owned state or the needed upstream/API work is documented.

### M8: tmux Adapter

Goal: attach nmux to tmux as an adapter without making tmux the core model.

Exit evidence:

- Adapter process boundary is documented.
- Basic session/tree mapping is tested.

### M9: herdr Adapter

Goal: keep any herdr integration outside the core repository and behind the nmux protocol.

Exit evidence:

- Integration boundary is documented.
- No AGPL code is copied into the nmux core.
